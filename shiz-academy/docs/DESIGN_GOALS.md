# Shiz Academy – Early Game Design Goals

Last updated: this session

## Core Principle
- Early fun comes from making good decisions, not big numbers.
- Players should outplay their stats via clear, intentional choices.

## Taste Over Stats (Early)
- Compatibility (Genre × Theme) matters more than stats in the first few songs.
- Gradually shift weight toward stats + fans as the year progresses.

## Readable Risk (Forecasts)
- Before performing, show simple, worded previews:
  - Critics: C–B / B–A
  - Fans: Mild / Strong
  - Financial risk: None / Low / High
- Players should see risk, choose it, and own the outcome.

## Time Is Tradeoffs
- 7-day weeks. Days spent:
  - Practice/Write/Perform → train stats for future songs
  - Gigs (old songs) → money/fans now, but slows new song progress
- Distinct playstyles (Writer-safe, Performer-volatile, Practice-future).

## One-Shot Focus (Per Song)
- Pick ONE lever per song (later scope):
  - Rewrite Chorus (+Writing this song)
  - Overpractice Vocals (halve RNG)
  - Hype Performance (fans ×1.5, score unchanged)
- Creates clutch moments without inflating stats.

## Venue = Scale & Responsibility
- Busking (safe, small), Pub (low), Club (medium), Stadium (high).
- Break-even thresholds; player chooses right venue for the song.
- Safety: Busking never loses money; early weeks cap losses.

## Gigs (Old Songs)
- Reperform fixed-quality songs; 1 day per gig.
- Earnings/fans depend on venue + freshness + repetition.
- Gigs train Stage/Vocals (with diminishing returns); busking trains faster.

## Failure Feels Informative
- Even weak songs produce visible progress (small fans, learning, events).
- Language blames scale/fit, not the player (“Venue was too ambitious”).

## Teaching Through Play
- First 2–3 songs emphasize compatibility and readable outcomes.
- Add light volatility and fan impact after players see the pattern.

## Invisible Safety Nets
- Early grade floor (≈C), reduced negative RNG, first A/S fan boost.
- Never advertised; players feel clever, not assisted.

## Authorial Choices Matter
- Naming the song, mood tags (later), and release approach build identity.
- Small mechanical nudges are enough; perceived authorship is the goal.

These principles guide tuning and feature choices to keep early play intentional, readable, and satisfying.
